# HunterFaction
A mod for Potion Craft adding a Hunter faction based on the vanilla Hunter Character. Uses BasicMod.

The code is commented with some of my findings while looking into the NpcSystem, please feel free to use it as a basis for adding your own factions.

This mod does not add quests by itself, but lets you add them via JSON using BasicMod. See https://github.com/hxpmods/MoreRequests for an idea of how to do that/ or to download sample quests.

Also, Factions aren't fully implemented in the base game, chances are something will break here as the game updates but the principles should be the same.
